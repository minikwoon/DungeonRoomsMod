# Dungeon Rooms Mod

### What it does:
This mod adds Secret Waypoints to Skyblock Dungeons, allowing for faster and easier secret finding. The hotkey to configure waypoints is "P" by default.

Alternatively, you can also view images of the secret locations in the DSG Discord or with the SkyblockPersonalized Mod by pressing the hotkey "O" while in a room.

### Dungeon Secrets Syncer:

A side mod of DRM, for those who find themselves repeating the same secrets as party members, this mod helps to sync and organize parties and the way they play dungeons!

This side mod can be downloaded [HERE](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hqbd3w9fmu2710c/Skyblock_Dungeon_Secret_Syncer.jar/file)

### Why is this useful?
For those who haven't memorized secrets, trying to find secrets takes forever, especially when you have to spend a ton of time searching through DSG channels for the right room. This mod makes it easy as you can immediately see where a secret is.

### Is this bannable?
Short answer: This mod follows the general interpretation of Hypixel's rules, does not modify packets in any way, and is most likely **not bannable**, but as with all mods, it is use at your own risk.
